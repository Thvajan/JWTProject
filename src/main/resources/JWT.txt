JSON Web Token - JWT

-Way for two parties to communicate securely
-Used for Authorization
-HTTP is Stateless protocol
-Server remembers users in a sessions using Tokens
	-Session Tokens - Reference to a state on the server
	-JSON Tokens - Value token contains the info itself
	
-Old way is to correspond token info in Cookies. Session info will be saved by server
	-Interms of microservices, all services can't save the same state

JWT allows servers to sign the info(JSON payload)as a Token and send it to the client.
	-In Subsequent requests the client sends the whole JSON token with the request.
	-Server understands the Token and allows the request
Can be sent via cookies

JWT Structure:
	-Header.Payload.Signature
	-Header and Payload are JSON objects encoded in Base64. Only for convenience
	https://jwt.io/
	-Header
		-tells how this is signed
		-has type and algorithm information ex: {"alg":"HS256","type":"JWT}
	-Payload is the actual Json data
	-Signature 
		-It is not to encrypt or decrypt, but for validating the info
		-It can only be calculated by the server, hence authentic.
		-if the server can't match the signature of the request, it doesn't provide request access.
		-The Signature's algorithm is the one mentioned in the header
		-the algorithm is used with a secret key that only the server holds
		-The Algorithm uses the encoded header and payload along with secret key to generate the signature part
	The value in the JWT token is open, as the token only provides authorization

Flow:	
1. The Initial user Authentication is done by whatever mechanism the server implements.
2. Only then the Server generates a JWT token(for future request authorizations) and provides it to the user.
3. The client can store it in a local storage or in a cookies
4. The user needs to send this JWT Token with future requests in its HTTP header
5. In HTTP header: <"Authorization":"Bearer "+<JWT Token>>
6. The server gets the new req with the JWT and splits it into header(decodes base64), payload(decodes base64) and signature
7. Calculates the signature and tries to match it.

JWT's data is open to all, so JWT transmission should be protected, as someone else can use the exact same JWT to communicate with the server.
Server can maintain blacklisted JWTs

Implementation:
Add jjwt and jaxb dependencies
Create jwt Util to generate and verfiy JWT tokens, extract claims and other details from the tokens
Create Rest end point accepts creds and authenticates the user and generates + returns the JWT
	-Post Method that gets AuthenticationRequest bean we created(has username and password)
	-uses Spring's AuthenticationManager.authenticate(
					new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(request.getUsername(), request.getPassword()));
	-throws BadCredentials exception on auth failure
	-on success, load the UserDetails by userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername
	-Use the jwtutil's generateToken method to generate new token
	-return responseEntity OK with the AuthenticationResponse(user created bean) with the jwt
In the SecurityConfig Class override authenticationManagerBean with default impl and override the cofigure for Httpsecurity to allow any request for /authentic endpoint.
	-return responseEntity OK with the AuthenticationResponse(user created bean) with the jwt
	
Subsequent request authorization:
	-Configuring project to accept request with header having Authorization:
	-Extract jwt token from header
	-Validate and set it in execution Context
	-Intercept Request by creating a custom filter by extending existing one
	-make the http based configuration stateless
	-add the newly created filter using httpSecurity.addFilterBefore(customFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)
